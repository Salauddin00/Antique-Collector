Bronze crafts in Bangladesh are manufactured totally by hand. The primary two things used in making brass crafts are wax and clay. These things are used to create a temporary mold that gives shape to the object. There are different categories of “mesturis” (carpenters): "level mesturis” who do plain work and “nokshi mesturis” who do the more intricate, delicate work. There are also “polish mesturis” who do things such as colouring and brightening the products. Below two processes are used for making brass wares based on their size and shape:

•	The lost wax process: Small objects that have solid brass inside are made in this process. Crafts made in this process are heavy in weight.

•	The hollow process: Large objects with hollow inside are made in this process. Objects made in this process are comparatively light in weight.
